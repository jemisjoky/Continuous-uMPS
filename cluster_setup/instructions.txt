### GETTING SSH SET UP ###

1) Modify the file `config` (in this directory) by replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your Mila login name. This is simply the part before the @mila.quebec in your Mila email address.

2) Check to see if you already have an SSH config file on your computer (it's the file ~/.ssh/config).

3a) If you do, copy the information in the `config` file (in this directory) to the bottom of your existing SSH config file.

3b) If you don't, copy the `config` file into the directory ~/.ssh

4) Run the command `ssh mila` in a terminal. It should ask you to enter a password, which is the same as the password for your Mila email address.

5) If everything goes well, then you should be inside the Mila network. Congrats! You can end the SSH session and go back to your own computer at any time by typing `exit` on the command line.

6) If you don't want to have to enter your password everytime, then follow these (totally optional) steps:

6a) On your own computer, run the command `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS"`, where YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS can be any preferred email address (not necessarily your Mila one). You'll be asked for a password, and feel free to leave that blank (just press Enter).

6b) Run the command `ssh-copy-id mila` and enter your Mila login password.

6c) Try logging into the Mila system with the command `ssh mila`. You should now be connected, without having to enter your password.
